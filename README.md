## Supported Statements

## Why a new database.

1.	Every data stored in this database is **automatically indexed** unless it is large.

2.	**Table Expansion** (a more comfortable form of joins)

3.	Seamless table definition update


## Regular Features

1.	Query Cache that can be turned "on" or "off". It improves the speed but comes at a cost of needing more RAM.

2.  Supports its own query language.


## Technologies Used.

* Ubuntu
* HTTPS
* JSON
